                Distributed and parallel algorithms
                         Homework 1

        In order to realize this homework I started from the sequential
implementation given. I created a structure where I saved all my data necesary;
structure's name is "Thread_arguments", declared in genetic_algorithm.h. The
structure has the following composition:
    - firstly we add all the variables that were used in the sequential
    implementation
    - after that, we add a barrier, which will be used during all the execution
    (the barrier is transmitted as a parameter because we need only one - and 
    must have only one barrier)
    - the number of threads that we're using

        After that, we move all the code in our thread function and start
parallelizing it:
    - first, we parallelize the input, using start and end points, just like we
    used in labs;
    - the next will represent an iteration for each generation
    - after that, we compute fitness and sort by it; calculate the start and end
    points, in order to parallelize the compute fitness function (which is also
    modified, adding a new parameter named start) and also the qsort
    - next step is to merge all the sorted subvectors; this operation cannot be
    parallelized, since we need to merge all the vectors after we sorted all the
    corresponding subvectors
    - then we keep first 30% (elite selection), also parallelized
    - mutate first 20% children with the first version of bit string; the
    mutation is being parallelized (using start and end)
    - then we mutate the next 20% children with the second version of bit
    string, operation also realized using start and end in order to obtain a
    parallel implementation
    - after we finish the iteration for each generation, we will do again the
    compute function and sort part we used before and thats pretty much all.

    Note: in this homework, I used only barriers, for security after every
    parallelized step which could lead to nondeterministic behaviour.
